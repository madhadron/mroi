MROI - MULTIPLE ROIS FOR IMAGEJ
Fred Ross <madhadron@gmail.com>

mroi extends ImageJ's region of interest system to multiple regions maintained independently across multiple frames of an image stack.  It maintains undo/redo information for all region operations, lets you save and load region collections, connect regions to their predecessors in previous frames, export region sets as trees based on those connections and including measurements on the regions, and provides hooks for writing new region-modifying tools that integrate with all the other functionality of the plugin.

I have provided a manual and quick reference sheet in the `doc/` subdirectory.  You will want to read through the manual to learn what mroi can do.

The latest functional version is always the master branch of Fred Ross (madhadron)'s repository at [`github`][github-repo].  You can download releases from the 'Downloads' section of the same page.

Installation
---------
If you downloaded a compressed release, uncompress it.  The resulting directory is the ready to use installation.  You can put it anywhere you like.  If you downloaded the latest version from the github repository, the resulting directory is also always ready to run.

On Windows, double click on `ImageJ.bat`.  On MacOS X, double click on `ImageJ.app`.  On Linux, run the script `run` in the mroi directory.  This should be all you need to do.
